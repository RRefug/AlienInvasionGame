  Alien Invasion is a 2D sprite game from the book Python Crash Course, designed to help its readers better understand how to program in python.
With the goal of having the reader use all of the knowledge they learned from the first 10 chapters to good use. Even providing a solution too!

  I read those same chapters a while ago, but never tried the projects in the second half of the book until now. As I am learning more and more about 
projects and programming languages with the projects and internship I aquired, I have been exposed to new coding practices and techniques to make me 
a better Software Engineer.
  That being said, the challenge I set out for myself with this project, wasn't to create the game from scratch, but to write unit tests for the 
code solution using Test Driven Development, Design Patterns, and the knowledge I possess with coding at the moment. 

  Leaping right into someone else's code helps give me a good practice of what to expect in the workforce, but also build upon someone else's code and improve it. 
Once I created enough ZOMBIE tests, I then began improving the code by adding new features since it is bug free! 
(Fully testing a program allows a user to run into less bugs meaning there will be less unpredicatable behavior when a user interacts with it.) 

These new features consist of more game mechanics such as map traversal, more sprite animations, more game mechanics, and more features than the original solution had!


Bug free code allows you to add features with ease, is what I've learned and of course, those features will be tested and created with Test Driven Development.  



I cloned the project solution from Bryanmacgro's GitHub
The copy of the solution comes from the GitHub Repository belonging to bryanmacgo (his GitHub link below!)

At the end of the project, I hope to show the end result and how it differs from the original. :D
